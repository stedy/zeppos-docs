3. Enter the following coordinate information in the configuration panel on the right:

- Center of Watchface rotation - The center point of the entire Watchface, the current Watchface resolution is 454 x 454, so the center coordinate of the Watchface rotation is (227, 227)
- Pointer rotation center - the coordinates of the rotation point on the pointer picture, reference to the figure below can be seen that the pointer rotation center coordinates of the current pointer are (25, 227)
